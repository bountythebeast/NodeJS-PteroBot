# NodeJS-PteroBot
 
 I do not recommend using this bot unless you know what your doing because i'm not good at this and probably won't be much better at troubleshooting the issue than you are.
 
This is a basic Pterodactyl control bot to help manage servers, containers, and what not from inside your discord server. 

A huge thanks to https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide, as this is entirely based off of their bot guide and is the how I got started.

The bot is currently in **BETA** and should only be used by people who can code themselves to troubleshoot errors, and understand what's happening.

ToDos:
- Expand examples
- Convert switch cases to JSON parse
- Add a HowTo Document to help jumpstart use of bot
- Document it at all?
